# Resilience4j Circuit Breaker Configuration for the 'productService' breaker
# This configuration applies to any method annotated with @CircuitBreaker(name="productService")

# The size of the sliding window to record outcomes. After 10 requests, it calculates the failure rate.
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.productService.slidingWindowSize=10
# The failure rate in percent. If 50% of the last 10 requests fail, the breaker trips.
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.productService.failureRateThreshold=50
# The duration the breaker stays open. For 10 seconds, it will immediately fail requests without trying.
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.productService.waitDurationInOpenState=10s
# How many requests are allowed in the "half-open" state (after the wait duration).
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.productService.permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState=3
